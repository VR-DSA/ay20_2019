# AY20 - Basic Astronomy and the Galaxy

Welcome to (what may be) your first course in "professional" astronomy! In this quarter, we'll cover introductory observational astronomy, garden-variety stars, star-clusters and the dynamics of the Milky Way, and the stellar life cycle from formation to stellar death. This GitHub page will contain all the course materials, logistical info etc. 

You will find lecture notes in the attached folder titled **LECTURES**. When problem sets etc are assigned they will be in the folder titled **ASSESSMENTS**. 

### The lowdown

* Instructor: Prof. Vikram Ravi (Cahill 302, office hours by appointment)
* TA: Yuping Huang (office hours by appointment)
* Schedule: Mon/Wed/Fri 11 am, Cahill 219. Recitation Thu 9 am, Cahill 219 (starting Oct 10).
* 25 lectures, 2 guest lectures, 1 exam review.
* Readings from textbook by Carroll & Ostlie (An Introduction to Modern Astronomy, 2nd ed.) noted in the syllabus below.
* Grading: 6 problem sets (30%), midterm (20%), project (20%), final (30%). 
* Late submissions: -50% per day for problem sets. No late exams or projects will be accepted. Exceptions only in extraordinary  circumstances with proof. 
* Collaboration: Usual honor code applies. Discussion in general terms of problem sets is allowed (both in and outside class), but you have to submit your own original solutions. No discussion of the midterm or final.

### Syllabus and readings
