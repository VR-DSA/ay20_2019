    "# Gaia Distance of the Open Cluster Pleiades\n",
    "Gaia is an European Space Agency (ESA) space mission that aims at measuring the position and parallax of 1 billion stars in our galaxy by revisiting each field 70 times over the mission lifetime. It will also provide radial velocity measurements for the brightest 150 million stars. For more about Gaia see https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/28820-summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Pleiades(M45), also known as the Seven Sisters, is an open star cluster that is visible to eyes in the night sky. It one of the closest star clusters. However, the distance to Pleiades has been controversial, because Gaia's predecessor, Hipparcos, measured a distance that was in disagreement with almost all other methods:\n",
    "<img src=\"pleiades.jpg\" width=500x>\n",
    "\n",
    "People have previously thought that the disagreement had to do with our lack of understanding of the physics of stars in this cluster. However, with more recent radio Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) measurements and new data from Gaia, it seems like the Hipparcos measurement was off for reasons that we still do not know. LÃ©o Girardi offered a good summary in his Perspective piece on the Science issue that published the VLBI results (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1001).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will get data from the Gaia catalog, isolate members of the Pleiades from other stars in the field, and measure the distance to the cluster!"

But measurements have uncertainties, and properly describing the uncertainties and converting the uncertainties in parallax measurements into distances is not always the most straightforward thing ever, because distance is not a linear function of parallax.
