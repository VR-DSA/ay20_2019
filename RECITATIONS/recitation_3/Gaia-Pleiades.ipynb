But measurements have uncertainties, and properly describing the uncertainties and converting the uncertainties in parallax measurements into distances is not always the most straightforward thing ever, because distance is not a linear function of parallax. I would recommend reading the Introduction of Bailer-Jones 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10121) to get a sense of the nuances involved in inferring distances from parallax measurements."
